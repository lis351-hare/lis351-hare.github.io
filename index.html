		<p style="color:blue;font-size:200%;font-family:trebuchet ms;"> Hello world! </p>

<p style="color:red;font-family:comic sans ms;"> My name is Shannon Hare. </p>

<p style="color:orangered;font-family:comic sans ms;"> This is my first time creating a website, and I had a lot of fun doing so. The process was both challenging and exciting. This website includes some of my favorite things, including my favorite movie, my favorite TV show, and my favorite place. I hope you enjoy the final product of my website and appreciate my hard work! </p>
